# Role Field Placement Options

## âœ… **Current Placement (After Email)**

**Order**: First Name â†’ Last Name â†’ Username â†’ Email â†’ **Role** â†’ Phone â†’ Password â†’ Confirm Password

**Reasoning**: Groups identity/profile information together before contact and security details.

## **Alternative Placement Options**

### **Option 1: After Last Name (Early Identity)**
```
First Name â†’ Last Name â†’ Role â†’ Username â†’ Email â†’ Phone â†’ Password â†’ Confirm Password
```
**Pros**: Establishes role immediately after basic identity
**Cons**: Might feel too early before username/email

### **Option 2: After Username (Core Identity)**  
```
First Name â†’ Last Name â†’ Username â†’ Role â†’ Email â†’ Phone â†’ Password â†’ Confirm Password
```
**Pros**: Role follows the main identifier (username)
**Cons**: Breaks up contact information flow

### **Option 3: At the End (Complete Profile)**
```
First Name â†’ Last Name â†’ Username â†’ Email â†’ Phone â†’ Password â†’ Confirm Password â†’ Role
```
**Pros**: Role as final step to complete user profile
**Cons**: Important field might be missed/forgotten

### **Option 4: Before Passwords (Logical Grouping)**
```
First Name â†’ Last Name â†’ Username â†’ Email â†’ Phone â†’ Role â†’ Password â†’ Confirm Password
```
**Pros**: Groups all profile info before security info
**Cons**: Role separated from core identity fields

## **ðŸŽ¯ Recommended: Current Placement**

The current placement after Email feels most natural because:

1. **Logical Flow**: Basic identity (Name, Username, Email) â†’ Role assignment â†’ Contact/Security
2. **Visual Balance**: Role dropdown balances well with Phone field (both half-width)
3. **User Mental Model**: "Who are they?" â†’ "What role do they have?" â†’ "How to contact?" â†’ "How to secure?"
4. **Form Scanning**: Role is prominent enough to not be missed but doesn't interrupt basic information entry

## **Easy to Change**

If you'd prefer a different placement, just let me know and I can quickly move it to any of these positions!
